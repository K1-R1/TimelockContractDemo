# TimelockContractDemo

This repo contains a simple time lock smart contract, written in Solidity. The purpose of this repo is for personal understanding. The purpose of a time lock contract is to create a:
 - `Queue  ->  Delay  ->  Execute`
 transaction sequence.

This allows any other users to react to a transaction before it's consequences are felt.
